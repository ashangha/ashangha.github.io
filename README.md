# My Personal Website
## http://ScottHSmith.com

I added my personal website to GitHub for four reasons: 

- To gain experience using git and GitHub
- As an additional backup in case all hell breaks loose
- Automatic deployments via GitHub hooks
- Obviously, for version control

My goal is to adhere to the highest, futureproof web standards, but if you see something wrong feel free to contact me, make an issue, or create a pull request. Enjoy!
